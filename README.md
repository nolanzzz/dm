This project represents a different version of the traditional association rule mining algorithm. The main concept is to discover the 
positive and negative rule of interest from the given dataset. Here, we use a simple dataset to test the accuracy of the implementation. 
The main idea of this implementation is supported by "Efficient Mining of Both Positive and Negative Association Rules", written by XinDong Wu,
ChengQi Zhang and ShiChao, Zhang. 

The implementation is written by RuiZhe Zhang, Xuhui Liu and Mei Cai for Course CSCI 4144 of Dalhousie.
